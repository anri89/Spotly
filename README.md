# Spotly 

A creative community map for students and young people in Bath

Spotly is a full stack web app that helps new students and young people discover the real Bath such as local cafes, pubs, study spots, events, and hidden gems shared by other students and locals


## Concept
When you move to a new city, it’s hard to know where the real vibe is the cool pubs, good coffee, cheap eats, or quiet places to read.  
Spotly solves that by letting users share personal experiences, photos, and event updates through an interactive map

Each location is pinned with short reviews, tags (like chill, lively, study spot), and user uploaded media 
The app builds a friendly community around exploring Bath together


## Unique Features
- Interactive map with user-generated pins  
- Posts with images, short videos, and text  
- User accounts with personal “albums” of places  
- Mood or vibe filter (e.g. quiet, party, artsy, cheap eats)  
- Comment or like system for interaction  
- Optional event or party invites (local social touch)


## How It Uses Data
- MongoDB stores user accounts, posts, and locations  
- Express & Node.js handle routes and APIs  
- Leaflet or Mapbox API for the interactive map  
- Optional integrations for events or student-discount APIs  
- Secure authentication ensures personal experiences and private data  


## Novel User Experience
Instead of traditional review apps, this focuses on vibe based discovery, users explore a city through moods and personal stories rather than ratings. 
It blends the feeling of a social network with the practicality of a map


## Target Audience
- University students and young adults living in or new to Bath  
- Locals who want to share authentic recommendations  
- Visitors who prefer personal, trustworthy insights instead of corporate guides


## Inspirations
- Google Maps (for navigation and pins)
- Airbnb (best in class map list sync, clustered pins, rich filters, and saved lists, like a wishlists)
- TripAdvisor (for sharing experiences)  
- Instagram Stories (for visual, personal moments)  
- Local community apps like Nextdoor or Meetup

  
Note: Airbnb doesn’t offer a public API, so for this project I don't use Airbnb data, only its UX patterns for inspiration

Spotly combines these familiar ideas in a creative, youth driven way
