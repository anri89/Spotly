# **Spotly**

### Discover the vibe & Share your world 

A creative community map for students and young people in Bath

Spotly is a full stack web app that helps new students and young people discover the real Bath such as local cafes, pubs, study spots, events, and hidden gems shared by other students and locals



## **Concept**

When you move to a new city, it‚Äôs hard to know where the real vibe is the cool pubs, good coffee, cheap eats, or quiet places to read.
Spotly solves that by letting users share personal experiences, photos, and event updates through an interactive map

Each location is pinned with short reviews, vibe tags (like chill, lively, study spot), and user uploaded media.
The app builds a friendly, authentic community around exploring Bath together

* Expand Beyond Bath

## **How It Uses Data**

* MongoDB stores user accounts, posts, locations, and events
* Express & Node.js handle routes, authentication, and APIs
* Leaflet or Mapbox API for the interactive map
* (Future) Integrations with external APIs for events or weather
* Secure authentication to protect user data and personal experiences


## **Novel User Experience**

Unlike traditional review apps, Spotly focuses on vibe based discovery, people explore cities through moods and moments rather than star ratings.
It blends the feel of a social network with the practicality of a map

Every feature is designed to feel personal, visual, and community driven, so users feel like they‚Äôre getting local advice from real people, not just reviews


## **Target Audience**

* University students and young adults living in or new to Bath
* Locals who want to share genuine recommendations
* Visitors who prefer personal, trustworthy insights instead of corporate guides

Spotly‚Äôs friendly and visual design makes it accessible, modern, and fun, built for people who value real experiences over algorithms


## **Inspirations**

* **Google Maps** for core navigation and pins
* **Airbnb** for rich visuals, map/list sync, and smooth user flow
* **TripAdvisor** for community reviews
* **Instagram Stories** for visual storytelling
* **Nextdoor / Meetup** for local connection and events

*Note:* Airbnb doesn‚Äôt offer a public API, Spotly doesn‚Äôt use Airbnb data, only draws inspiration from its design and interaction patterns.

Spotly combines these familiar ideas in a new, youth driven, and playful way.
